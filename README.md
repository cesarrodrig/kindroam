# KindRoam

Export Kindle highlights to Roam, grouping them by books.

## Use Case

`KindRoam` is for people who:

* usually read books or articles not purchased through Amazon and
* want to import their Kindle highlights in Roam and
* don't want to pay for Readwise just to do this.

Kindle highlights can be accessed at read.amazon.com but only for books that
were bought in the Kindle store. If you use something like Instapaper or import
your ebooks by email or USB, your highlights are only accessible through
a file called `My Clippings.txt` inside your Kindle. That makes it extremely
annoying if you want to use your highlights as a starting point for a book
summary or re-read them without having to click through the ebook.

There is an app called Readwise that offers the feature of exporting Kindle
highlights by directly parsing `My Clippings.txt` but it is a paid app.
It offers great features but if you want to keep your toolbox small and
focused on Roam, it might not make sense to pay only for the exporting.


## Description

KindRoam exports Kindle highlights into Roam pages, grouping them by book
and writting them as Markdown files. It keeps track of the last time the
highlights were exported so only the newest ones are used.

When importing an already existing page, Roam appends the new data, so
KindRoam makes sure to only export highlights that have not been written
before.

The Markdown files are written to a folder and they can be directly
imported to Roam. Each book gets its own Roam page. After importing the
highlights, the files can be deleted manually or using the `clean`
command. It is recommended to import all generated Roam pages before
doing a new export because books with new highlights will be overwritten.


### Highlight Notes

Kindle offers the feature of adding notes to a highlight. Unfortunately,
they are not distinguishable from normal highlights in `My Clippings.txt`.
To get around this, you can mark your notes with an initial `+` so `kindroam`
recognizes them and attaches them as a sub-block. For example, if your note is
`This highlight is important to me.`, it needs to be `+This highlight is
important to me.` so it can become a sub-block.

When Roam imports Markdown files, all the sub-blocks are collapsed. You can
expand them all by right-clicking the page title and selecting `Expand All`.


## Installation

To install the command-line tool, run:

```
pip install .
```

After this, `kindroam` is available as a CLI.

## Usage

To export highlights from a `My Clippings.txt` file, use the `export`
command. If you are using OSX and have your Kindle plugged in, you
can run:

```
kindroam export
```

Otherwise, you need to specify where the `My Clippings.txt` file is with
the `-f/--filename` option:

```
kindroam export -f "My Clippings.txt"
```

The created Roam pages are exported to the folder `books` in the project
directory. They are ready to be used with the `Import` feature in Roam.
